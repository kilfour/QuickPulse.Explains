# QuickPulse.Explains
`QuickPulse.Explains` is a lightweight documentation generator for C# projects,
designed to turn `[Doc]`-annotated test classes and methods into clean, structured Markdown files.
It leverages the `QuickPulse` library for declarative flow composition and supports
both single-file and multi-file generation with namespace-based filtering.
